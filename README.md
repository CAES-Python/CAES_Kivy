# Kivy

To use this file, Kivy 1.9 must be installed. Also this file uses the knob module kivy.garden.knob and the gauge module kivy.garden.gauge which can be found on github. The garden widget files can be found at https://github.com/CAES-Python/CAES_Kivy_Garden and placed in the garden folder found in "~/.kivy/garden".  I have modified the __init__.py file and the images for the gauge module, which are included in this folder.
